# Calcium-Fiber-Photometry-Analysis
These Matlab scripts and functions were created for Michaelides' Lab to analyze fiber photometry across multiple animals to visualize raw data, normalize that data, add it to structures, analyze AUC in 5-minute buckets, and analyze spikes and events in 5-minute buckets for saline vs. drug conditions.
